# -Sierpinski-Triangle-
 Sierpinski triangle  a fractal attractive fixed set with the overall shape of an equilateral triangle, subdivided recursively into smaller equilateral triangles. 
It can be created by useind this simple algorithum.
1) Take three points in a plane to form a triangle.
2) Randomly select any point inside the triangle and consider that your current position.
3) Randomly select any one of the three vertex points.
4) Move half the distance from your current position to the selected vertex.
5) Plot the current position.
6) Repeat from step 3
